Introduction to data analysis and machine learning. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the interpretability of a CNN that detects pneumonia from chest Xrays.
We will utilize a dataset consisting of 5,232 labeled chest X-rays images of pediatric patients,
ages 1 to 5, acquired at the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center. Prior work using
this dataset to train CNNs to classify pneumonia have failed to address unaccounted for artifacts in
several chest X-rays. We believe that these artifacts adversely effected the prior CNN’s performance.
The removal of these artifacts, via masking or exclusion of the affected images, should result in an
increase in CNN performance. Furthermore our exploration of Grad-Cam as an interpretability
technique should give us a deeper understanding of the CNN’s decision making process.
